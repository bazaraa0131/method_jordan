# Jordan’s Second Method — Linear System Solver

## Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of **Jordan’s second method** (pivot-based table transformation) for solving systems of linear equations of the form:

\[
A x = b
\]

The solver works with **exact rational arithmetic** and supports interactive pivot selection.

## Files
- `solver.py` — Command-line entry point, argument parsing, and main execution loop  
- `utils.py` — Core data structures and Jordan pivot logic  
- `const.py` — Constants used for table cell types and output formatting  
- `solve.sh` — Convenience shell script for running the solver

---

## Requirements
- Python **3.10+**
- Standard library only (`argparse`, `fractions`, `copy`)

---

## Usage

### Run directly
```bash
python solver.py
